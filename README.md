# APPLICATIONS LIST - MOODLE BLOCK

**IMPORTANT**: I am no longer maintaining this plugin. However if you require changes to it you can submit a Merge Request and I will gladly have a look into it.

## DESCRIPTION

This block is dependent on another local plugin (https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=local_applications) that allows users to manage applications and access them without leaving Moodle. This block list all the favorite applications of a user and allows him to add new applications or access the applications management page.
